# VI_SIMULATOR

This project contains a standalone Visual Inertial Simulator in order to test different
visual inertial odometry(vio) and SLAM algorithms.

The majority of this project derives from the OpenVINS project. This version ,however,
only has a single dependency on Eigen, whereas OpenVINS requires OpenCV and ROS.

It also has an optional dependency on Pangolin, which allows you to visualize the sim
results.
